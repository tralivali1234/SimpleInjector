Describe your problem, question, or feature in a clear and concise way. Please make sure you:

* Provide a **[Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)** that reproduces the problem, illustrates your question, or shows the feature you are missing.
* Show **what you've tried**.
* Show a **simplified, but realistic, representation of your application**. We are not interested to see a large amount of source code, but DI-related questions are typically design questions and it is impossible to feedback on your design when you reduce your interfaces and classes to e.g. `IFoo`, `Flux` and `Baz`.
* Include **complete stack trace including all exception details** of the exception and all inner exceptions in case an exception is thrown.
* Do **not include screen shots** of [code](https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofcode), but provide actual code
* Do ensure that code listing don't have a **line width that exceeds 100 characters**, as that would cause horizontal scrollbars, which make it harder to view the code.
* Do not include screen shots of [exceptions](https://idownvotedbecau.se/imageofanexception/), but paste the actual exception details
* Make sure that code and exception details are [formatted correctly](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) and ideally include the programming language (typically `c#`). This way GitHub will highlight the code automatically.
* Follow the guidelines given by Stack Overflow and [IDownvotedBecau.se](https://idownvotedbecau.se/) about asking good questions.
* If you think a feature is missing, consider providing an example of a possible API.
